# Python

Python was invented by Guido Van Rossum.



## Introduction
  Python is a High-level,general - purpose programming language.
  Its design philosophy emphasizes code readibility with the use of significant indentation.
## Basic Python

## DATATYPES
 
In Python we use mainly three datatypes:
-> Integer(int) datatype stores whole numbers.
Ex: 1,2,3

-> Float-float datatype stores decimal values.
Ex: 22.22,4.32

-> String- (str) Anything Written in b/w quotes('',"",)known as string.
Ex: "aswini" 

## Variables

. Variables saved on temporary memory (RAM) not in permanent 
  memory.
  
. int and float datatypes occupies 4 bytes of memory.

. string datatype occupies 1 bytes for each character and space 
  in  between the string is also a character for example 'python' 
  is a string which has 6 characters and each character holds the 1
  byte memory.

 . we can find the address of an variable by using the id
   (variable) function. 

. we can find a type of a variable by using the type(a) function.
## Rules to create a variable

. Variable should not start with a number if you want to use 
  number as a variable use underscore(_) in starting.

. Variable should be a single word or a character if you want to 
  use multiple words use(_) in between them.

. Python variables are completely casesensitive.

. Don't use the below punctuations as a variable like !,@,#,$,%,<,>
   ,&,*,(,).

  

 
## print statements in python

. we have 4 types for print in python.

. TYPE 1 :
         
         . Using comma(,)we can add one datatype inside the print
           with another datatype and the comma (,) will provide the
           one tab space.

. TYPE 2 :

         . Using + operator 
         . In this type it adds only two string variables and
           doesnot add anythong like string to int.
         .  In case of any variable in int or float datatype,we 
           have to convert it into string datatype to add with 
           another variable.
         .  It is most leastly used in the realtime.

. TYPE 3 :

        . In this type we use the identifiers to print the 
          varibale.
        . for int datatype we use %d.
        . for float datatype we use %f.
        . for string datatype we use the %s.

. TYPE 4 :
        
        . Using f function and {}
        . It is mostly used in the realtime.
        . example: print(f'my name is {variable}')
